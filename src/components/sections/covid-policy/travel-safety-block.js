          <h5>Staff Training</h5>
          <p>
            In order to have an effective cleaning and sanitization program, the teamâ€™s health, safety, and knowledge are vital. Accordingly, all colleagues have received specific training on WHO and Ministry of Health approved COVID-19 preventive and responsive protocols which include but are not limited to Hand Hygiene, Respiratory Hygiene, Physical Distancing, Cleaning and Sanitizing best practices, Safe Food Handling and Food Hygiene. Our Health &amp; Hygiene manager personally reviews and ensures all protocols are stringently followed.

            Temperature screening is implemented at all entrance points, including both for guests and employees.

            We are practicing physical distancing throughout the hotel.
            
            The number of guests accessing services at any one time will be controlled and a queue control system consistent with physical distancing advice is established.

            Floor markings such as with tape are provided to facilitate distancing as well as in common areas.
            Space tables ideally 2 meters apart in dining areas.

            Any other facilities available in a common area or for common use such as gym equipment must be at least 1 meter apart.
            The number of staff in one specific area at any one time should be limited. Staff can be organized into groups or teams to minimize interaction between groups.
